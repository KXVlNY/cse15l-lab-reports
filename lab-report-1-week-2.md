> **Installing *VSCode* **

> **Remotely Connecting**
* If you use **Windows**, you **MUST** install a program called **OpenSSH**: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse
* Search your course-specific account for CSE15L and **RESET** your password for that account here: https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php
* The reset can take anywhere **from 1 minute to 20 minutes** to start working, so please be patient. Your lab account should look like this format: **cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu** (replace **"zz"** with the letters in yours)
* Open a terminal in the **VSCode** (Ctrl or Command + **`**, or use the **Terminal â†’ New Terminal menu option**).
* Type **ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu** on the terminal (Replace "zz" with the letters in yours)
* Since this is your first time, you likely get a warning message like this: 
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
* Type **yes**, then enter your password
* Once you are logged in, you shoud see something like this:
